# Snapshot Test

A React application for testing and demonstrating snapshot testing and UI verification capabilities.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), providing a robust foundation for building and testing React applications.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/uma-victor1/snapshot-test.git
cd snapshot-test

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Start development server
npm start
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or pnpm package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uma-victor1/snapshot-test.git
cd snapshot-test
```

2. Install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload when you make changes.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. This is particularly useful for running snapshot tests and verifying UI changes. See the [testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. The build is optimized for best performance with minified files and hashed filenames, ready for deployment.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot revert.**

Ejects from Create React App configuration, giving you full control over webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other build tools. Only use this if you need advanced customization.
